# Traffic
AI to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph.

## Overview:

This project focuses on the development of a neural network to classify traffic signs from images using TensorFlow. The neural network is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different types of traffic signs.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Loads and preprocesses the traffic sign images from the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Builds and trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) for traffic sign classification.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of the model on test data.
- **Prediction**: Classifies new traffic sign images.
